If you are thinking about a custom home DIY project, you’re probably wondering whether it is worth the cost savings. Custom houses tend to cost more than new houses being built by constructors, given that they require more time, money, and expertise to build. They also cost more than previously built houses, as many of these properties have experienced problems with plumbing and electrical issues, and the list goes on. At the end of the day, it’s worth it to capitalize on a custom-built house that is created from scratch with your requirements.

The Total Price of Custom Home DIY Project

The cost of a custom house depends on a number of aspects, including the scope and location of the lot you plan to shape on and the building supplies needed to complete the job. Here’s what you will need to consider:

Cost of Examinations and Architectural Efforts

First, you need to purchase the land and arrange for the required site work before you start on the DIY project for house building. The price of these initial stages can add up, but they are all essential. For example, you will require building permits, water, and sewer lines inspection, etc.

Diggings and Foundation

Once you receive the building permit and have the land inspected, it’s time to lay the stone for your custom home according to the plan your designer has shaped. The cost of this stage will include excavation and pouring the concrete that will help as the foundation of your new home.

Cost for Framing

Next is the framing process. This stage comprises framing all the walls, windows & doorways, roof, placing the trusses, etc. This is where the cost of labor you are saving, as well as in the next few stages when you do the exterior and interior surfaces.

Cost of Exterior Finishing

The exterior finishing stage includes all that needs to occur in order to close the structure in from the outdoor. The cost of this will include exterior Window / Door Installation, Wall Finishing, Rooftop Fitting, installing PVC Systems, Columns, Shutters, Gables, Brackets, Louvres and Soffit, etc.

Plumbing, electrical, and HVAC installation

Once the exterior construction of your house has been built, you can go for electrical, plumbing and HVAC installation. This will save up a major chunk of your budget.

Interior Finishing Cost

The internal finishing stage is where you’ll devote most of your money, as this includes all from insulation and drywall fitting to doors, installing trim, painting the rooms, hooking up light fixtures, and installing countertops, cupboards, flooring, appliances, etc.

Finishing touches

Some of your savings can be expended on interior design essentials, such as mirrors and custom furniture, as well as other basics of your property, like redesigning, patio or deck installations, and driveway concrete pouring.
